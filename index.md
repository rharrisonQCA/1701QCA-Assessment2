### Related project 1 ###
PuzzleBox

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arduino/puzzlebox-c1f374?ref=search&ref_id=puzzle&offset=0

![Image](openingbox.jpg)

This project is related to mine because I would like the outcome of my game box to have a reward for solving the puzzle/problem. AS a result of this, this project is related to mine through the technology used and the function of said technology. For in both projects, a servo is used to unlock the box, revealing the reward for resolving the problem at hand. These servo’s horns would only be activated once the user completes or solves the problem through the use of lights, buttons, etc. to eventually activate the servo horns to activate and open. Therefore, this project is related to mine through its similarities of technology, function and concept.

Electronic Puzzle Box uses only Discrete Components

https://hackaday.com/2014/05/14/electronic-puzzle-box-uses-only-discrete-components/

This project is related to mine through its concept of various puzzles for the user to solve in order to open the dice container. For my project, the user will be asked to accomplish various puzzles like obtaining a specific colour, all lights to be on or off, reaching zero or a certain number while each button adjusts in random variables. However, this project also uses the tilt function of the program, which would be cool to implement into my project as a problem to solve somehow. These lead this project to be related to mine through its concept, technology and fabrication.

"Bomb" Diffuse Game

https://ramenboii.weebly.com/vis-147a/final-project-bomb-diffuse-game

![Image](bombgame.jpg)

This project is related to mine through it’s materials, concept and code. These can be seen through the use of a separate breadbox from the mounting plate, LEDs, cardboard and paper. The cardboard and paper in this project help with the aesthetic of the game, while my project will use this combination to form a box and be decorated with paper to be aesthetically pleasing. While this project requires the user to disconnect wires to disarm, the concept and code are similar to my game box. They are similar through having a set timer to solve the problems before the box remains forever “locked”. As well as having the same concept of having to do something to get an outcome. For this project the outcome is to prevent the bomb blowing up, while my project sees a container to open up. These projects are led to be related together through material, function and code.

Turning Lock Puzzle

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/krishnalalith/turning-lock-puzzle-356d56?ref=search&ref_id=puzzle&offset=4

![Image](lockpuzzle.jpg)

This project is related to mine due to the code used and the function that it leads to. In this project, when an individual digit is changed, the neighbours (left and right) of this digit are also changed. The function of this project sees that the user is required to change the numbers into the correct combination, with this project acting as a luggage lock. These are related to my project as I aimed to implement this type of number change into the game box, but with changing the surrounding numbers in various variable adjustments. As well as having this problem would take the user one step closer to solving the box and getting it open. As a result of this, these projects are related through concept, code and function of project.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes - Physical Edition

http://www.dillonlareau.com/projects/KTANE_physical

![Image](keeptalking.jpg)

This project is related to mine as it gave inspiration to create my own project. These two projects are also related through fabrication of projects. For this project, there is a section of the ‘bomb’ that requires the user to use their memory with the implemented lights to disarm a section. However, for this project it uses more materials and technology than what I have access to. As a result of this, it is planned to use the LED’s and alfoil to develop my own version of a pattern for the user to memorise and replicate. In the end, these projects are related through concept and fabrication as a result of inspiration.

Interactive Toddler Music Box Toy

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/68284/interactive-toddler-music-box-toy-2c8dcf?ref=search&ref_id=box&offset=28

![Image](musicbox.jpg)

This project is related to mine through its material and fabrication. For starters, it is planned to design my project first with cardboard and paper to ensure the concept, technology and everything words correctly and accurately. From there, it is planned to make my project simpler, much like this music box project, the components would be above the wood, thus hiding the wires and other technology beneath. This then leads both projects to be related together through their material and fabrication use. 

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

FIND AT LEAST 3 OF THIS

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence.*

### Design concept 1 ###
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
*Put details here.*

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
